  * Break the verbs into their own apps
  * Have verbs accept commands from STDIN rather than the command-line
  * Verbs return JSON-encoded strings and so to display must be piped into
    show-message to decode the JSON and print the string.
  * Recover from recoverable errors without taking the director down.
